# LLM Finetuning

This repository contains resources and code for finetuning Large Language Models (LLMs) using custom datasets and image-to-text tasks.

## Project Description

This project focuses on training and finetuning LLMs using image-to-text tasks, where each image is represented as a 50x50 black and white matrix. These matrices serve as input data, allowing the model to learn from pixel-level information and generate corresponding text outputs. The approach is suitable for tasks such as image captioning, pattern recognition, or any scenario where binary image data is mapped to textual descriptions.

## Project Structure

- `LLM_finetunning.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for running and documenting the finetuning process.
- `image_to_text.json`: Dataset or configuration file for image-to-text tasks.
- `image_to_text_smart.json`: Alternative or enhanced dataset/configuration for image-to-text tasks.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/warhawkmonk/LLM_finetunning.git
	cd LLM_finetunning
	```

2. Open `LLM_finetunning.ipynb` in JupyterLab or VS Code to explore and run the finetuning workflow.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face Transformers (if using for LLM finetuning)
- Other dependencies as specified in the notebook

## Usage

- Prepare your dataset in the format specified in `image_to_text.json` or `image_to_text_smart.json`.
- Follow the steps in `LLM_finetunning.ipynb` to preprocess data, configure the model, and start finetuning.
